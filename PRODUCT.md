# Product

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

web

## Users

People deciding whether a physical home or living store is worth visiting. They can browse anonymously, compare nearby options, and contribute an account-backed review after a real visit.

## Product Purpose

Boşa Gezme! helps people discover physical home and living stores, visit with better expectations, review what they experienced, and help the next person decide where to go.

## Positioning

The product is consumer social discovery centered on physical visits. It is not ecommerce, a merchant directory, a SaaS dashboard, or a chatbot.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Support Turkish, English, German, and Russian, including long copy and Cyrillic.
- Keep Boşa Gezme! community data separate from externally sourced Google data.
- Never fabricate store facts, reviews, scores, media, or commercial claims.
- Preserve the Next.js BFF boundary; this client never calls the backend directly.
- Anonymous browsing is first-class; social mutations and reviews require authentication.
- Target WCAG AA, keyboard access, visible focus, reduced motion, and responsive layouts.

## Brand Commitments

The approved name is **Boşa Gezme!** and the canonical domain is `bosagezme.com`. Preserve Turkish diacritics and the exclamation mark. Use the approved hunting-dog assets in `public/brand/` sparingly; real store content remains dominant. Copy is direct, warm, and free of AI hype.

## Evidence on Hand

The canonical API contract and valid fixtures live in the sibling `home-app-api` repository. No testimonials, merchant claims, or performance claims are approved.

## Product Principles

1. Let real stores, visits, and community content carry the experience.
2. Keep discovery useful without exposing the AI behind search.
3. Make trust and attribution clear without heavy chrome.
4. Adapt deliberately to each platform rather than forcing pixel parity.
5. Make every contribution help another person decide whether a trip is worthwhile.
